		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>My name is Tyler, and I live in Canada. I made this website because I wanted to have a place 
			where I could share and archive some of my projects. I mostly make music, but I have also made
			a few programming projects, as well as some miscellaneous things that I think are useful or 
			interesting.</p>

		<h2>Updates</h2>
		<p>March 3, 2018<br>
			Added a sample pack in the projects section, as well as a collection of levels for Doom 2!
